# HeartDiseasePrediction
The project is a hackathon on Zindi Africa. It revolves around the creation of a sophisticated predictive model aimed at determining the likelihood of an individual having heart disease. As one of the leading causes of global mortality, detecting heart disease in its early stages is pivotal for enhancing patient outcomes and halting its progression. 

The objective is to design and build a predictive model capable of accurately determining the probability of an individual having heart disease. The focus is on leveraging machine learning techniques to create a model that can analyze relevant features and provide reliable predictions. The model should demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability, ensuring its effectiveness on new, unseen data.

Got a predictive accuracy of 81%
